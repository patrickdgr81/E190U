#Motion Blur
I did a motion blur for this lab. To review, a motion blur is when you take into account where the object was
previously to determine where the object currently should be drawn. For example, if an object is moving at 
high speeds, it looks like a blur due to the motion blur. To do this with code, I kept track of where the
object was before the current iteration.

<pre><code>
if (strcmp(playerName,"bot") != 0) {
	   fprintf(accuracyTest, "Player %s fired!\n", playerName);
	}
accuracyTest = fopen("accuracyTest.txt","w");
deathTest = fopen("deathTest.txt","w");
        if ((accuracyTest == NULL)||deathTest == NULL) {
	  printf("Error opening file !\n");
	  exit(1);
	}
</code></pre>
